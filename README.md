# SERP Swarm Embeded Robotic Platform-

Swarm Embedded Robotic Platform **(SERP)** is a low cost robot designed for robotics hobbyists and enthusiasts.  SERP will help you get acquainted with the world of robotics and embedded systems. With SERP, instead of building the robot with the different components from scratch, one will be able to create and contribute to complex applications that run on this platform, helping you acquire expertise as you spend more time with them. 
 
SERP robot is based on Cortex M3 microcontroller. 

**Secifications:**
